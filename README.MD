# Spearman's Rank Correlation Calculator

This Python application built with Tkinter enables users to compute Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for two datasets. The tool assists in analyzing the strength and direction of monotonic relationships between variables.

## Features

- **Dynamic Table Generation**: Users input the number of rows, and a table is dynamically created to input the dataset.
- **Correlation Calculation**: After data input, users can calculate Spearman's rank correlation.
- **Result Display**: The application displays the correlation coefficient and its category, indicating the strength and direction of the relationship.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script.
2. **Input Rows**: Enter the number of rows for the dataset.
3. **Enter Data**: Input dataset values into the dynamically generated table.
4. **Calculate Rank**: Click "Calculate Spearman's Rank".
5. **View Result**: The correlation coefficient and its category will be displayed.
