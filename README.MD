# Spearman's Rank Calculator

This is a Python application built with Tkinter that allows users to calculate Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for two sets of data.

## Features

- Users can input the number of rows for their dataset.
- A table is dynamically generated to input the dataset.
- After inputting the data, users can calculate Spearman's rank.
- The application displays the correlation coefficient and its category.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script.
2. Input the number of rows.
3. Enter the dataset into the table.
4. Click on the "Calculate Spearman's Rank" button.
5. The correlation coefficient and its category will be displayed.
